					<p>
					I am currently a member of Sightlines in this SY 19 - 20, as part of the Crew division. </br>
					Last year (SY 18 - 19), I was also a member in the Writer's division, although I was quite inactive within the club. </br>
					During SY 17 - 18, I was not in Sightlines, but I attended one of their productions titled "Waving Through a Window." </br>
					I intend to be active within the club this year. </br>
